If I want to develop a agent using a framework, say langchian framework, and I want my agent be compitable with
1. [[the Harbar framework](https://harborframework.com/docs/getting-started)](https://harborframework.com/docs/getting-started)
2. and [the inspect-ai framework](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/)
so that I can evaluate/benchmark my agent using this 2 agent, as you can see how my agent should be providing to be able to run inside Harbor and inspect-ai, see this 2 docs:
[Integrating your own agent](https://harborframework.com/docs/agents#integrating-your-own-agent) and
[insepct ai Custom Agents](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/agent-custom.html)

what requirement should my agent implementation fullfill?
